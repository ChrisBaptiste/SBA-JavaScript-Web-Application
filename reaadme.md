This Prototype Back Pack Traveller app will only load the map api on the screen with live Server Only. 
The app will not function properly if you open it in your default Browser


This is a Proto Type app of a Budget friendly Back Pack Planner for Geo & Cultural nomads, solo travellers and Digital nomads entrepreneurs.

The idea of the app is to make it convenient and Budget friendly for people who love travelling to Buy cheap flights on the app. The app is using Moch Data for now because i could not find a flight api that was free and most of them only work with back end stuff and i have not learned how to do this yet. I also wanted to add cheap accomadtions for my app users to find cheap accomadation in the country of destination but did not have enough time to add it in.  

ProtoType 2 of the app will incorporate the features mention above so that the app will be more convenient and user friendly






SBA 308A:  JavaScript Web Application
Version 1.0, 08/18/23 Click here to open in a separate window.
Introduction
This assessment measures your capability to implement advanced JavaScript tools and features in a practical manner. You have creative freedom in the topic, material, and purpose of the web application you will be developing, so have fun with it! However, remember to plan the scope of your project to the timeline you have been given.
This assessment has a total duration of two (2) days. This is a take-home assessment.
You have two total days (including weekends and holidays) to work on this assessment. This assessment will be due at 5:00pm on the second day after it is assigned. Your instructor may provide you with class time to work on the assessment, schedule permitting.
Objectives
Use asynchronous JavaScript tools to build a responsive web application.
Demonstrate understanding of the JavaScript event loop.
Generate asynchronous code using Promises and async/await syntax.
Use fetch and/or Axios to interact with an external web API.
Organize files using modules and imports.
Submission
Submit the link to your completed assessment using the Start Assignment button on the Assignment page in Canvas.
Instructions
You will create a small single-page web application. The topic and content of this application is entirely up to you; be creative!
Your work will be graded according to the technical requirements listed in the following section. Creativity and effort always work in your favor, so feel free to go beyond the scope of the listed requirements if you have the time.
Keep things simple. Like most projects you will encounter, you should finish the absolute minimum requirements first, and then add additional features and complexity if you have the time to do so. This will also help you understand what you can get done in a specific allotment of time if you were to be asked to do something similar in the future.
Once you have an idea in mind, approach your design through the user's perspective. User experience is one of the most important aspects of successful web design. If users enjoy their time on with your application, they are more likely to trust whatever services or information you offer, and more likely to come back and use the application again in the future.
You will need access to an external API in order to complete the requirements listed below. Since the content of the API will largely determine the content of your application, it should be chosen first and carefully. You can look for available APIs across the internet, but make sure they include features that will allow you to implement the requirements listed below.
Click here for a list of free APIs you can use. Two of our favorites, which contain all of the features necessary for this assessment are The Cat API and The Dog API. You are not limited to these APIs or any others in the list above. Feel free to get creative! 
Requirements
The requirements listed here are absolute minimums. Ensure that your application meets these requirements before attempting to further expand your features.
Create your application locally, and initialize a local git repo. Make frequent commits to the repo. When your application is complete, push your repo to GitHub and submit the link to the GitHub page using the submission instructions at the top of this document.
